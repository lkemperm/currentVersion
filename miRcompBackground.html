<p>This package uses data from a dilution / mixture experiment to assess methods that estimate microRNA expression from qPCR amplification curves. Specifically, this package provides assessments of accuracy, precision, data quality, titration response, limit of detection, and complete features. Each of these is described in the following sections. To avoid any confusion due to naming conventions (expression estimates from amplification curves have been called Ct values, Crt values, and Cq values to name a few), we refer to the reported values as expression estimates or simply expression.</p>

<p>Life Technologies has designed a qPCR miRNA array panel to work within their TaqMan® OpenArray® system. The current version of the array has coverage for 754 human miRNAs and additional non-human miRNAs for normalization controls/spike-ins across two primer pools. For raw data analysis, LifeTechnologies uses a closed ExpressionSuite software package to analyze qPCR data. There are a number of previously developed open-source packages to analyze raw qPCR fluorescence data; however, unlike microarray and RNAseq data, raw qPCR data are typically analyzed using the manufacturer’s software. In fact, several open-source packages take expression values (e.g. Ct, Crt, or Cq values) as input, ignoring how these values were estimated. To assess the potential benefits of alternative expression measures, we developed miRcomp, a benchmark data set and R/Bioconductor package to facilitate the development of new algorithms to preprocess LifeTechnologies® OpenArray® miRNA data and to provide tools to integrate the data into other software packages from the Bioconductor tool set.</p>
